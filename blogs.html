                  In programming, the scope is defined as the accessibility of the variable. Each variable in JavaScript has its own scope.
                  In JavaScript, there are 3 types of variable scope, namely: <br>
                    1. Global Scope <br>
                    2. Function Scope <br>
                    3. Block Scope <br>
                    Although, there used to be only two types of scopes before ES6, the global scope, and the local scope. But, with ES6 local scope was broken down into function scope and block scope. <br>
                  <br>
                    <strong class="fs-6">Global Scope:</strong> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
                  <br /><br />
                  <strong class="fs-6">Block Scope:</strong> Block scope is a sub-type of local scope. A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly braces are called as within block scope. <br>
                  In JavaScript, a block is denoted by curly braces. A variable declared with var in a block scope is available outside of that block scope. Variables declared with let inside a block scope are only accessible inside that scope.

                  JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
                  <br>The <strong>event loop</strong> allows js to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite the fact that JavaScript is single-threaded.
                  Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks.
                  The event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task.
                  The event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.
                  The event loop executes the tasks starting from the oldest first.
                  <br>
                  When the timer set by setTimeout function (in this case 1000 ms) runs out, the callback is sent to the event queue. The event loop on finding the call stack empty takes the task at the top of the event queue and sends it to the call stack. The callback function for setTimeout function runs the instruction and “This is the second statement” is logged on the console and the task is popped from the stack.

                    <strong>Undefined</strong> is also a primitive value in JavaScript. A variable or an object has an undefined value when no value is assigned before using it. So you can say that undefined means lack of value or unknown value. Some reason of retrun undefined is given below: <br>
                    <strong>1.</strong> When you declare a variable and don’t initialize it to a value, the variable will have a value of undefined.<br>
                    <strong>2.</strong> You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property or method of an object.<br>
                    <strong>3.</strong> If you pass less arguments in function call then, that parameter will have undefined value. <br>
                    <strong>4.</strong> An undefined evaluates to false when used in conditional expression. <br>
                    <strong>5.</strong> A function that doesn’t have a return statement implicitly returns undefined. <br>
                    <strong>6.</strong> Accessing a out-of-bounds array element returns undefined. <br>
